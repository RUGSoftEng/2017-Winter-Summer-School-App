# Webinterface Winter and Summer School

A webinterface used by the coordinators of the Summer and Winter schools of the University of Groningen to interact with a database. The users may post, update or delete announcements, information sections and appointments in a schedule. 

## Installation
Install by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUGSoftEng/2017-Winter-Summer-School-App.git
```
Or download the ZIP file and extract it.
## Running the server
If NodeJS has been installed, you can run the server by entering the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
node server.js
```

By default the server is listening on port 8800. Therefore, the webinterface can be accessed on [localhost:8800/](localhost:8800/).
